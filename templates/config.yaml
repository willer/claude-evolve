# claude-evolve configuration file
# This file defines paths and settings for the evolution process
# 
# NOTE: The evolution directory is automatically inferred from this config file's location.
# For example, if this file is at /path/to/my-experiment/config.yaml,
# then the evolution directory will be /path/to/my-experiment/
