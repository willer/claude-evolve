# Evolution Brief

## Objective

Describe what you want to optimize or evolve.

## Performance Metric

Define how success will be measured (e.g., speed, accuracy, efficiency).

## Baseline Algorithm

Describe the starting point algorithm or provide a reference implementation.

## Constraints

List any constraints or requirements (e.g., memory limits, API compatibility).

## Notes

Additional context or considerations for the evolution process.
