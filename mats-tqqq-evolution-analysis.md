# MATS-TQQQ Evolution Analysis Report

## Summary

The MATS-TQQQ evolution system appears to be functioning well in terms of building on prior winners, though there are some issues with result caching and duplicate evaluations.

## Key Findings

### 1. Parent Usage Pattern
The system is successfully using high-performing algorithms as parents:

**Most Used Parents:**
- `gen07-014` (33 times) - Performance: 0.7429 (highest performer)
- `gen01-305` (32 times) - Performance: 0.6949 (second highest)
- `gen05-002` (15 times) - Performance: 0.5486 (strong performer)
- `gen01-249` (10 times) - Performance: 0.4205
- `gen08-012` (8 times) - Performance: 0.5490

The evolution system is correctly identifying and heavily utilizing the top performers as parents.

### 2. Ideation Strategies Working Well

The descriptions show appropriate use of parent algorithms:

**Hill Climbing Examples:**
- gen07-004 (parent: gen01-305): "Adjust RSI thresholds from 20/80 to 25/75 for earlier entry and exit signals"
- gen08-005 (parent: gen01-305): "Adjust TRS RSI thresholds from 90/10 to 85/15 for more frequent but potentially safer signals"
- gen10-006 (parent: gen01-305): "Tune TRS 2025 RSI period from 2 to 4 for less sensitive momentum readings"

**Crossover Examples:**
- gen07-012 (parent: gen01-305): "Combine TRS 2025 standalone logic from gen01-305 with regime-switching Kalman filter from gen05-002"
- gen08-012 (parent: gen07-014): "Combine balanced Profile 3 weights from gen01-243 with TRS 2025 standalone logic from gen01-305"
- gen08-013 (parent: gen01-305): "Merge TRS 2025 standalone implementation from gen01-305 with Kalman filter regime detection from gen05-002"

### 3. Issues Identified

**Caching Problem:**
- 8 algorithms have description "Loaded cached credentials" 
- 13 algorithms have identical performance score: 0.39997533260734086
- 10 algorithms have identical performance score: 0.007978595141452076

This suggests the evaluation system is sometimes returning cached results instead of re-evaluating modified algorithms.

**Zero Performance Scores:**
- 63 algorithms have performance score of 0.0
- Many of these have rejection reason "Negative return in 2025"
- This is expected behavior - algorithms that perform poorly are correctly scored as 0

### 4. Evolution Progress

The system shows signs of actual evolution:
- Early generations explored various profile weights
- gen01-305 (TRS 2025 standalone) emerged as a strong performer
- Later generations correctly focus on combinations with gen01-305
- gen07-014 achieved the highest score (0.7429) by combining Profile 3 weights with TRS 2025
- Subsequent generations are building on gen07-014

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Caching Issue**: Investigate why some algorithms are returning "Loaded cached credentials" and identical scores
2. **Continue Current Strategy**: The system is correctly identifying and building on winners
3. **Monitor Diversity**: While focusing on winners is good, ensure some exploration continues
4. **Validate Unique Evaluations**: Add checks to ensure each algorithm is actually evaluated uniquely

## Conclusion

The MATS-TQQQ evolution is working as designed in terms of:
- Identifying high performers as parents
- Using appropriate hill climbing (parameter tweaks) on successful strategies  
- Creating meaningful crossovers between complementary strategies
- Building incrementally on prior successes

The main issue is the caching problem causing duplicate results, which should be addressed to ensure proper evolution progression.
