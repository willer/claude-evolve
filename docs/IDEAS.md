- Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Add code complexity analysis
- Create automated documentation generation
- Add automatic changelog generation from conventional commits
- Implement semantic versioning based on conventional commit types
- Consider adding commit message linting for conventional commit standards (âœ… COMPLETED)
- Add git hook integrity checks to prevent legacy hook conflicts
- Implement automated commit message template generation for consistency

### Build System

- Add Docker containerization for consistent development environment
- Implement cross-platform build verification
- Add automated changelog generation
- Create release automation workflows

## Future Phase Ideas

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Implement structured error codes and recovery suggestions
- Add error telemetry collection (with privacy controls)
- Create error reproduction scripts for debugging
- Add graceful degradation modes

### Configuration System

- Add configuration file support (.claude-evolve.json)
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Add configuration validation and migration tools
- Create configuration templates for common scenarios

### Monitoring and Observability

- Add execution time tracking and optimization suggestions
- Implement resource usage monitoring (memory, CPU)
- Create performance regression detection

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements

- **Automated Testing Matrix**: Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with multiple OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows WSL)
- **Shell Script Coverage**: Implement code coverage reporting for shell scripts using tools like bashcov or kcov
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Add automated performance tests to detect CLI execution speed regressions
- **Integration Test Environments**: Create Docker-based test environments for consistent testing across platforms
- **Test Data Management**: Implement test fixture management for reproducible testing scenarios
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Optimize test suite execution time through parallel test running
- **Test Result Reporting**: Add comprehensive test result reporting with trend analysis
- **Mock Service Improvements**: Enhance Claude API mocking with more realistic response scenarios and error conditions

### Enhanced Timeout Management

- **Granular Timeout Controls**: Support timeout specification in minutes/hours (e.g., `--timeout 5m`, `--timeout 2h`)
- **Process Group Management**: Implement proper process group cleanup to handle evaluators that spawn subprocesses
- **Timeout Recovery Strategies**: Add automatic retry mechanisms for timeout scenarios with backoff logic
- **Cross-platform Timeout**: Ensure consistent timeout behavior across Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL environments
- **Timeout Monitoring**: Add real-time timeout countdown display during evaluation execution
- **Smart Timeout Recommendations**: Analyze historical evaluation times to suggest optimal timeout values
- Add execution analytics and insights
- Implement CSV schema validation to catch column mismatch issues at runtime
- Consider using a more robust CSV parsing library or approach to prevent manual column indexing errors

## Architecture Improvements

- Add undo/rollback functionality for destructive operations

## Repository Management

### Branch Protection Enhancements

- Consider adding required status checks once CI/CD is implemented in Phase 7
- Evaluate enabling linear history requirement to simplify merge scenarios
- Add automated branch protection rule updates when new CI checks are added
- Implement branch protection rule validation/testing to ensure proper configuration
