# Claude-Evolve – Implementation Plan

The plan is organised into sequential _phases_ – each phase fits comfortably in a feature branch and ends in a working, testable state. Tick the `[ ]` check-box when the task is complete.

---

## Phase 0 – Repository & SDLC Skeleton

- [x] Initialise Git repository (if not already) and push to remote
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Git repository initialized, remote configured as https://github.com/willer/claude-evolve.git, and all commits successfully pushed to origin/main.
- [x] Add `.gitignore` (node*modules, evolution/*.png, \_.log, etc.)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive .gitignore implemented covering Node.js dependencies, OS files, editor files, build outputs, and project-specific evolution artifacts.
- [x] Enable conventional commits / commitlint (optional)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Commitlint configuration properly set up with conventional commit standards, integrated with pre-commit framework, and tested to reject invalid commits while accepting valid ones.
- [x] Configure branch protection rules (main protected, feature branches for work)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Branch protection rules configured for main branch - requires PR reviews (1 approver), dismisses stale reviews, enforces admin compliance, blocks direct pushes and force pushes.
  > ⚠️ **PROCESS VIOLATION**: Developer worked directly on main branch instead of creating feature branch, contradicting established workflow. Future work must follow "One feature branch per phase" process.

### Tooling Baseline

- [x] `npm init -y` – create `package.json`
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Generated package.json with default values for claude-evolve project.
- [x] Add `bin/claude-evolve` entry in `package.json` (points to `./bin/claude-evolve.sh`)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Added bin field to package.json enabling CLI functionality via "./bin/claude-evolve.sh".
- [x] Install dev-dependencies:
      • `shellcheck` & `shfmt` (lint/format shell scripts)
      • `@commitlint/*`, `prettier` (markdown / json formatting) > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Installed shellcheck, shfmt, @commitlint/cli, @commitlint/config-conventional, and prettier. Added npm scripts for linting and formatting. Downloaded shfmt binary locally due to npm package issues.
- [x] Add **pre-commit** config (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) running:
      • shellcheck
      • shfmt
      • prettier –write "\*.md" > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created .pre-commit-config.yaml with hooks for shellcheck (shell linting), shfmt (shell formatting), and prettier (markdown formatting).
- [x] Add Husky or pre-commit-hooks via `npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky install"` > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Using pre-commit (Python) instead of Husky for better shell script linting integration. Pre-commit hooks successfully configured with shellcheck, shfmt, and prettier.

---

## Phase 1 – Minimal CLI Skeleton

Directory layout

- [x] `bin/claude-evolve.sh` – argument parsing stub (menu + sub-commands)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created main CLI script with argument parsing, command routing to `cmd_<name>` functions, and interactive menu.
- [x] `lib/common.sh` – shared helper functions (logging, json parsing)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implemented logging functions, JSON parsing with jq, file validation, and utility functions with proper error handling.
- [x] `templates/` – default files copied by `setup`
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created template directory with BRIEF.md, evaluator.py, and algorithm.py templates for project initialization.

Core behaviour

- [x] `claude-evolve --help` prints usage & version (from package.json)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implemented help functionality with comprehensive usage information and dynamic version extraction from package.json.
- [x] No-arg invocation opens interactive menu (placeholder)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Interactive menu system with numbered options for all commands, proper input validation, and error handling.
- [x] `claude-evolve <cmd>` routes to `cmd_<name>` bash functions
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Command routing system implemented with proper argument passing and unknown command handling.

Unit tests

- [x] Add minimal Bats-core test verifying `--help` exits 0
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive Bats test suite covering help flags, version flags, command routing, error handling, and exit codes. Updated package.json test script.

---

## Phase 2 – `setup` Command ✅

> ✅ **COMPLETED**: `cmd_setup` fully implemented to initialize evolution workspace.

- [x] `claude-evolve setup` creates `evolution/` folder if absent
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created `evolution/` directory as needed.
- [x] Copy template `BRIEF.md`, `evaluator.py`, baseline `algorithm.py`
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Templates copied to `evolution/` directory.
- [x] Generate `evolution.csv` with header `id,basedOnId,description,performance,status`
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Evolution CSV file created with correct header.
- [x] Open `$EDITOR` for the user to edit `evolution/BRIEF.md`
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Brief file opened in editor in interactive mode; skipped if non-interactive.
- [x] Idempotent (safe to run again)
  > ✅ **COMPLETED**: Re-running command does not overwrite existing files or reopen editor unnecessarily.

---

## Phase 3 – Idea Generation (`ideate`) ✅ COMPLETED

> ✅ **COMPLETED**: `cmd_ideate` fully implemented to generate algorithm ideas with AI-driven and manual entry modes.

- [x] `claude-evolve ideate [N]` (default: 1)
- [x] Prompt Claude (`claude -p`) with a template pulling context from:
      • The project `evolution/BRIEF.md`
      • Recent top performers from `evolution.csv`
- [x] Append new rows into `evolution.csv` with blank performance/status
- [x] Offer interactive _manual entry_ fallback when `–no-ai` is passed or Claude fails

---

## Phase 4 – Candidate Execution Loop (`run`) ✅ COMPLETED

> ✅ **COMPLETED**: Core `cmd_run` functionality fully implemented with comprehensive error handling and CSV manipulation.

Basic MVP ✅

- [x] Implement `cmd_run` function with complete evolution workflow
- [x] Implement CSV manipulation functions in lib/common.sh:
  - [x] `update_csv_row` - Update CSV rows with performance and status (with file locking)
  - [x] `find_oldest_empty_row` - Find next candidate to execute
  - [x] `get_csv_row` - Extract row data for processing
  - [x] `generate_evolution_id` - Generate unique IDs for new evolution files
  - [x] CSV file locking mechanism for concurrent access (atomic updates with .lock files)
- [x] Select the **oldest** row in `evolution.csv` with empty status
- [x] Build prompt for Claude to mutate the parent algorithm (file path from `basedOnId`)
- [x] Save generated code as `evolution/evolution_idXXX.py` (preserves Python extension)
- [x] Invoke evaluator (`python3 $EVALUATOR $filepath`) and capture JSON → performance
- [x] Update CSV row with performance and status `completed` or `failed`
- [x] Stream progress log to terminal (ID, description, performance metric)

Error handling ✅

- [x] Detect evaluator non-zero exit → mark `failed`
- [x] Graceful Ctrl-C → mark current row `interrupted` (signal handler with trap)

### Process Notes

• One _feature branch_ per phase or sub-feature – keep PRs small.
• Each merged PR must pass tests & pre-commit hooks.
• Strict adherence to **YAGNI** – only ship what is necessary for the next user-visible increment.
