# Error Handling Simplification - 2024-07-31

## Summary of Changes

Simplified error handling per user feedback to focus on what matters: did the file change?

### Key Philosophy Changes

1. **No interpretation of AI output** - Just log exit codes and output length
2. **Continue on partial success** - If some strategies work, that's good enough  
3. **Raw debugging info** - Show what actually happened, not interpretations
4. **Resilient operation** - Keep trying other AIs/strategies instead of failing early

### Specific Changes

#### lib/ai-cli.sh
- Removed usage limit detection (was causing false positives like "tokens used")
- Simplified output validation to just check exit code
- Always log: exit code, output length
- Show raw output on errors or when VERBOSE_AI_OUTPUT=true
- Removed special exit codes and interpretation

#### bin/claude-evolve-ideate  
- Each strategy continues even if others fail
- Success if at least one strategy works
- Changed ERROR to WARN/INFO for non-critical issues
- Shows strategy success rate (e.g., "2/4 strategies succeeded")

#### bin/claude-evolve-run
- Added CONTINUE_ON_IDEATION_FAILURE environment variable
- When set to true, continues evolution even if ideation completely fails
- Waits 60 seconds before retrying after complete failure

### Usage

Normal operation:
```bash
claude-evolve run
```

Continue despite ideation failures:
```bash
CONTINUE_ON_IDEATION_FAILURE=true claude-evolve run
```

Verbose debugging:
```bash
VERBOSE_AI_OUTPUT=true claude-evolve run
```

### What This Fixes

1. **False positives** - O3 saying "tokens used: 1426" won't be misinterpreted as usage limit
2. **Premature exits** - Evolution continues if any strategy works
3. **Useful debugging** - See actual AI responses, not interpretations
4. **Resilient operation** - Partial success is still success
